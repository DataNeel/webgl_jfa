* dial in pebbles and negative space

* adapting to a different aspect ratio (involves handling dimensions in the shader)

* smoothing out some edges (theyâ€™re literally bumpy, and I have some hypotheses as to why)


* Handling more variables (dimensions, width, density, etc)
    * more flexible rules
    * pebble count
    * color


* adding slight texture in the negative space

* jfa enhancements
