* combining the code that makes the structure with the code that makes the texture (right now, this is actually the output of two pieces of code)
    * try drawing in webgl
        start with circle
        then port code
            remove p5 vector
            use code to create arrays of points
            draw lines instead of circle
            figure out blend mode

            draw both glyphs
    * try drawing in js and passing to webgl
    * try drawing in p5 and passing to webgl

* adapting to a different aspect ratio (involves handling dimensions in the shader)

* smoothing out some edges (theyâ€™re literally bumpy, and I have some hypotheses as to why)

* Handling more variables (dimensions, width, density, etc)

* adding more negative space (see above)

* adding slight texture in the negative space
